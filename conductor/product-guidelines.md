# Product Guidelines

## Tone & Voice
- **Persona:** The app (Kalli) should embody a **Warm Professional** persona.
  - **Do:** Be encouraging, positive, and supportive. Use natural, conversational language.
  - **Don't:** Be overly enthusiastic ("ra-ra!"), slang-heavy, or cold/clinical. Avoid robotic or strictly transactional phrasing.
- **Goal:** To make the user feel supported in their health journey without feeling patronized.

## Visual Design
- **Style:** **Clean & Modern** but optimized for mobile constraints.
  - **Whitespace:** Use whitespace effectively to separate elements, but be mindful of the limited screen real estate in a chat interface. Avoid excessive padding that pushes content off-screen.
  - **Elements:** Use rounded corners and a cohesive color palette consistent with the existing design system.
  - **Readability:** Prioritize legible typography and clear hierarchy.

## Interaction Design
- **Animations:** **Minimalist.**
  - Prioritize speed and responsiveness over decorative transitions.
  - Use simple state changes (e.g., button press states) rather than complex motion for now.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear, immediate feedback for user actions (e.g., successful data entry) without slowing down the flow.

## Accessibility
- **Approach:** Follow the existing project design system patterns.
- **Future Consideration:** WCAG compliance and advanced accessibility features (Dynamic Type, High Contrast) are deferred for later iterations.
